To share files between your Windows host machine and the Cloudera Linux-based VM (running in Oracle VirtualBox), you can use Shared Folders. Here's how to set it up properly:

🛠️ Step-by-Step: Add Files from Host (Windows) to Cloudera VM (Linux)
✅ 1. Install Guest Additions in the Cloudera VM (Required for Shared Folders)
Start your Cloudera VM.

In the VM window menu, go to:
Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD image…

Open a terminal in Cloudera VM.

Mount and install the CD:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mkdir /mnt/cdrom
sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
cd /mnt/cdrom
sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
Reboot the VM:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo reboot
If you get errors like “Kernel headers not found”, install them using:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo yum install -y kernel-devel gcc make perl
✅ 2. Create a Shared Folder in VirtualBox Settings
Shut down the VM (do not suspend).

In Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager, select the Cloudera VM and click Settings.

Go to Shared Folders > Machine Folders > Click + (Add Folder icon).

Set:

Folder Path: Choose the folder on your Windows system you want to share.

Folder Name: e.g., shared_data.

Check Auto-mount and Make Permanent.

Click OK and start the VM again.

✅ 3. Access Shared Folder Inside Cloudera VM
After rebooting, your shared folder should be available at:

bash
Copy
Edit
/media/sf_shared_data
Note: If you get a "Permission Denied" error:

🔒 Fix Permission Error
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo usermod -aG vboxsf cloudera
Then log out and log in again (or reboot).

✅ 4. Now You Can Copy Files
On Windows:

Put files in the shared folder (e.g., D:\MyShared).

On Cloudera VM:

Access them at /media/sf_shared_data.

💡 Tip: Alternate Method — SCP (if Shared Folders Don't Work)
You can also use scp or WinSCP to transfer files via SSH if the network is configured correctly.

Let me know if you want help setting up SCP, or if you're using a different version of Linux than the Cloudera QuickStart VM.
